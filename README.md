64-bit ARM processor for Computer Architecture course at Rowan University.
## Git
To set up git on your Windows machine, use [Git For Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and follow the install instructions. 
Change to the branch with your name on it `git checkout [name]` and make your chnages to the project.
You should periodically save your work on your local machine. Use `git add [file]` to stage your files for commit, or alternatively, use the wildcard (`*`) to add all files in the directory. Then use `git commit -a` to commit all of these changes. A text editor will appear for you to write a commit message, where you should briefly describe the changes made. The message should be in the imperative mood, so instead of writing "changed x to do y", you should write "change x to do y" or "add y functionality to x", etc. You could also use `git commit -am "[Message]` to skip the editor and directly type your commit message.
This section will be here when I figure out how to merge or rebase correctly.
